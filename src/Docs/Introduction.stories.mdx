# Welcome to Egde-UI! ðŸ‘‹

<hr />

This frontend-library contains a variety of sleek looking, easy to use and rich React components which
build upon [Charka UI](https://storybook.chakra-ui.com/?path=/story/components-data-display-badge--basic).
The primary goal of this library is to provide frontend elements, templates and more that are all free
to use as this is an open-source project.

<br />

# General information ðŸ“ƒ

<br />

## Components ðŸ“¦

All Component pages are marked with one of the three stability-badges. These will quickly tell if the
component in question is working properly, has issues, or is on the way out.

<ComponentStability variant="stable" />
<ComponentStability variant="unstable" />
<ComponentStability variant="deprecated" />

<br />

Another thing to note is that the "Show code"-option, which displays the source code of a component, suffers
from a bug where nested elements inside of component props are being displayed wrongly. Instead of showing
the nested elements as they are defined e.g. `<p>Text</p>`, a MDXCreateElement-tag is being displayed
`<MDXCreateElement mdxType="p" originalType="p">Text</MDXCreateElement>`. Currently there are no official
solutions to this issue so all components which are affected include a warning about this as shown below.

<div className={'docsPage'}>
    <ChakraProvider theme={styles}>
        <Alert
            description={
                "There is a bug with 'Show Code' where nested components inside of props are being enclosed by a MDXCreateElement-tag."
            }
            status="warning"
            hasNoCloseButton={true}
        />
    </ChakraProvider>
</div>

<br />
