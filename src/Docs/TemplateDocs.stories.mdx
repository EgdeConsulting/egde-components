# How to add a new template to Storybook üìù

<hr />

Besides showcasing individual components Storybook can also display how these individual components can
be combined to form finished solutions. These templates can show how e.g., a homepage or login could look
like. By following the steps below, you'll be able to add new templates to Storybook in a standardized manner
using docs-pages.

<br />

## Step 1:

Create a new file called `_templateName_.tsx` inside of the sub-folder `src/Components/Templates`.
This file is going to contain the source code of the new template. Start of editing the file by adding the
following two import-statements:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Story } from '@storybook/react';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> `Story` is a datatype which is used to define React components as stories, which then again can be exported
> and imported to docs-pages.

<br />

## Step 2:

Next create a `Template` constant like shown below, and replace `...` with the implementation of your template.

```jsx
const Template: Story = (args) => {
    return (
        ...
    );
};
```

For a template named "Homepage" the implementation could look like this:

```jsx
const Template: Story = (args) => {
    return (
        <PageContainer {...args} title={'Homepage!'}>
            <SimpleGrid columns={2}>
                <Grid gap={25} templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)">
                    <Card
                        title={'Check properties'}
                        body={
                            'Here you can check the properties of the components'
                        }
                        cardWidth={'320px'}
                        cardHeight={'112px'}
                        titleTextSize={'sm'}
                        actionIcon={<ArrowRightIcon />}
                    />
                    <Card
                        title={'Mail'}
                        body={'Press here if you want to read your E-Mails'}
                        cardWidth={'320px'}
                        cardHeight={'112px'}
                        titleTextSize={'sm'}
                        actionIcon={<MailIcon />}
                    />
                    <Card
                        title={'Parking'}
                        body={
                            'Here you can register your parking. Avoid the fines'
                        }
                        cardWidth={'320px'}
                        cardHeight={'112px'}
                        titleTextSize={'sm'}
                        actionIcon={<ParkingIcon />}
                    />
                </Grid>
            </SimpleGrid>
        </PageContainer>
    );
};
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> Add all the necessary imports at the top of the file after the previously added imports. Make also sure to
> use `from 'Components'` or `from 'Icons'` when importing components and icons.

<br />

## Step 3:

The last thing left to do inside of the tsx-file is to export the template story. While doing so we also have to
provide some default prop-values as following:

```jsx
export const Base = Template.bind({});
Base.args = {
    ...
};
```

For a template named "Homepage" the implementation should look like this:

```jsx
export const Base = Template.bind({});
Base.args = {
    backgroundColor: 'grey',
    borderColor: 'border',
    borderWidth: '1px',
    containerMargin: '50px 336px 50px 336px',
    containerMinWidth: '800px',
    containerPadding: '40px 56px 40px 56px',
    contentPadding: '0 56px 40px 56px ',
    subtitle:
        'As an employee, you have access to various services based on your rights. See your services below.',
    subtitlePadding: '16px 154px 32px 154px',
    titlePadding: '40px 0 0 0',
};
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> `Template.bind({})` takes the earlier defined arrow-function (step 3) and provides a reference to the Story.

> The `args` property is here being used to pass default prop-values to the react components inside of `Template`.

<br />

## Step 4:

Next create the docs-page for the new template by adding a file called `_templateName_.stories.mdx` to
the component-folder, and start editing the file by including the following four import-statements were
`_templateName_` needs to be replaced:

```jsx
import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { DocsPageHeader } from 'Docs';
import { Root } from 'Types';
import * as stories from './_templateName_';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> `Meta` is one of the three "Storybook docs-blocks" we are going to use, and its sole purpose is
> to define the display name and location for the content inside `_templateName_.stories.mdx` within
> Storybook.

> Follow the links to learn more about the [Story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/doc-block-story)
> and [Canvas](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/doc-block-canvas) "Storybook docs-blocks".

> `import * as stories from './_templateName_';` searches through the specified file and makes all found
> stories available.

<br />

## Step 5:

Beneath the import-statements add a local export-statement and Meta-tag like shown:

```jsx
export const templateName = '_templateName_';

<Meta title={Root.Templates + templateName} />;
```

For a template named "Homepage" the export-statement and Meta-tag should look like this:

```jsx
export const templateName = 'Homepage';

<Meta title={Root.Templates + templateName} />;
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> We need to use `export` before `const` as MDX-syntax requires it.

<br />

## Step 6:

Next up use the earlier imported `DocsPageHeader` component. This is a special made React
component which adds a default header layout to the docs-page. For templates only the `description`
will have a unique value which needs to be set manually.

```jsx
<DocsPageHeader
    title={componentName}
    description="..."
    addImportantNote={false}
    variant="none"
/>
```

For a template named "Homepage" the DocsPageHeader-tag should look like this:

```jsx
<DocsPageHeader
    title={templateName}
    description="This template shows how you can use the PageContainer and Card component to create a Homepage."
    addImportantNote={false}
    variant="none"
/>
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> The table below shows all of the props for the DocsPageHeader component.

<ArgsTable of={DocsPageHeader} />

> The props `title` and `description` are used to declare a heading and description, while `variant`
> is responsible for adding a stability-badge. This badge is supposed to give a quick and easy way
> of knowing if a component is stable or not, use `none` if it is desired that no badge should be
> displayed. The prop `addImportantNote` adds an alert message to the top of the docs-page which will
> display the text defined in `noteMessage`. Note that `noteMessage` isn't mandatory and will only be
> required when `addImportantNote` is set to `true`.

<br />

## Step 7:

The last step is to add the imported `Base` story to the docs-page and give the story a fitting name.
Both of these things can be done as follows:

```jsx
<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story name="_templateName_" story={stories.Base} />
</Canvas>
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> The `withToolbar` prop enables a toolbar at the top of the code-canvas which includes buttons for zooming.

> `Template.bind({})` takes the earlier defined arrow-function (step 4) and provides a reference to the Story.

> Sometimes the default height of the Canvas isn't enough to display the whole component, in this case a scrollbar
> is automatically added to the Canvas. This is not a desirable solution since it makes viewing the whole component
> tedious. To solve this issue, use the `height` property of the Story-tag like shown below:
>
> ```jsx
> <Canvas withToolbar>
>     <Story name="_templateName_" height="600px" story={stories.Base} />
> </Canvas>
> ```
