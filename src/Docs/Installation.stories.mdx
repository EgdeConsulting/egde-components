# Local Project - Installation and Setup 🔨

<hr />

Installation of the Egde Component Library should in theory be easy as pie since
the project is configured with git and yarn. All that's needed is for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
to be installed and that you follow the 3 steps below.

<br />

## Step 1:

Clone the egde-components repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/EgdeConsulting/egde-components.git
```

<br />

## Step 2:

After having cloned the repository run the following command from inside the project folder
in order to automatically install all of the needed node-modules and project dependencies
inside the project folder.

```
yarn install
```

**Notes ❗**

> If you run into issues with yarn not being enabled on Windows 10 with `Node.js >= 16.10`,
> open `CMD` or `Powershell` **with** admin rights and run:
>
> ```
> corepack enable
> ```

> On Windows it's possible that Visual Studio Code will run into an error when trying to
> execute yarn-commands from the internal terminal (see the error below). Deleting the
> specified file in the error message will solve the issue.

> Another error which can be encountered during installation is that yarn runs into network timeouts.
> These errors are caused by bigger packages which take longer to install than the default network-timeout
> timeframe, typical offenders are the Chakra-UI and Chakra-UI-Icons packages. To solve this issue run:
>
> ```
> yarn install --network-timeout 1000000
> ```

<br />

## Step 3:

All the components are documented in what is called MDX-files. These are markdown files (.md) with JSX
support. Most IDE's don't have built inn support for syntax-highlighting on MDX-files, therefore it is
strongly advised to install an extension which add said support.

-   [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx)

<br />

## Step 4:

To check that the installation went well, and that the component library works as expected, run the
command shown below. It will start Storybook locally on your PC at `localhost:6006`.

```
yarn storybook
```
