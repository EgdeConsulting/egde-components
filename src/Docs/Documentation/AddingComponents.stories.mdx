# How to add a new component to Storybook üìù

<hr />

Storybook is a sleek and interactive solution for creating documentation libraries of all kinds.
In this case it's to showcase different React components, and how they can be utilised in different
contexts. To ensure that this component library is clear and easy to use, there is a standard
template for how new components should be added to the library using docs-pages. By following the
steps below, you can add new components in no time while making sure that they are being displayed
correctly in Storybook.

<br />

## Step 1:

Create a new sub-folder inside of `src/Components/.../_componentName_` where `...` corresponds to
the category under which the new component should be listed, and `_componentName_` is replace with
the actual component name.

<br />

## Step 2:

Inside of the component-folder create and export a new React component in a `.tsx` file. Afterwards export
the React component by adding a `index.ts` file to the component-folder where you:

```jsx
export * from './_componentName_';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> Make also sure to include the export-statement in the sub-folder above!

<br />

## Step 3:

Next create the docs-page for the new component by adding a file called `_componentName_.stories.mdx` to
the component-folder, and start editing the file by including the following four import-statements were
`_componentName_` needs to be replaced:

```jsx
import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { DocsPageHeader, DocsPageBodyComponents } from 'Docs';
import { LibPath } from 'Types';
import { _componentName_ } from 'Components';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> `Meta` is one of the three Storybook docs-blocks we are going to use, and its sole purpose is
> to define the display name and location for the content inside `_componentName_.stories.mdx` within
> Storybook. In addition to that we'll also use `Meta` to declare a set of default component props.

> Follow the links to learn more about the [Story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/doc-block-story)
> and [Canvas](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/doc-block-canvas) Storybook docs-blocks.

> We are able to use `from 'Components'` thanks to the export-statements we set up in step 2.

<br />

## Step 4:

If the new component works on its own (standalone) without having to wait for an event-handler to trigger
in order to be displayed correctly use alternative 1, otherwise follow alternative 2.

### Alternative 1:

Create two local export-statements as follows:

```jsx
export const Template = (args) => <_componentName_ {...args} />;

export const componentName = '_componentName_';
```

For a component named TextAreaInput the export-statements should look like this:

```jsx
export const Template = (args) => <TextAreaInput {...args} />;

export const componentName = 'TextAreaInput';
```

<!--![Example of how the export-statements should look like](https://i.imgur.com/BQyv9N0.png)-->

**Notes ‚ùó**

> We need to use `export` before `const` as MDX-syntax requires it.

<br />

### Alternative 2:

Create two local export-statements like shown. `Template` needs to implement both the
new component and all the logic required to trigger the desired event which ensures
that the component is displayed correctly.

```jsx
export const Template = (args) => {
    ...
    return (
        <div>
            ...
            <_componentName_
                {...args}
                {...}
            />
        </div>
    );
};

export const componentName = '_componentName_';
```

For a component named AlertDialog the export-statements should look like this:

```jsx
export const Template = (args) => {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
    const handleClose = () => setIsOpen(false);
    const buttons = [
        {
            label: 'OK',
            onClick: () => {
                setIsOpen(false);
            },
            variant: 'primary',
        },
    ];
    return (
        <div>
            <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}> Open Alert Dialog </Button>
            <AlertDialog
                {...args}
                onClose={handleClose}
                isOpen={isOpen}
                buttons={buttons}
            />
        </div>
    );
};

export const componentName = 'AlertDialog';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> Make sure to include all the necessary import-statements at the top of the file if
> other components and elements are being used inside of `Template`.

<br />

## Step 5:

Beneath the export-statements add a Meta-tag like shown where `_category_` corresponds
to the category under which the new component should be listed, and `...` needs to be
replaced with all of the component props and a default value.

```jsx
<Meta
    title={LibPath._category_ + componentName}
    component={_componentName_}
    args={{
        ...
    }}
/>
```

For a component named TextAreaInput the Meta-tag should look like this:

```jsx
<Meta
    title={LibPath.Form + componentName}
    component={TextAreaInput}
    args={{
        label: 'Title',
        labelTextMargin: '10px',
        placeholder: 'Placeholder',
        onChange: () => {},
        value: '',
        invalidText: '',
        captionText: 'Caption text',
        isDisabled: false,
        margin: '5px',
        padding: '0',
        width: '100%',
        minWidth: '0',
        backgroundColor: 'transparent',
        autoFocus: false,
        maxWidth: '100%',
        characterLimit: 1000,
        captionTextMargin: '10px',
    }}
/>
```

<!--![Example of how the Meta-tag should look like](https://i.imgur.com/vbOjgO6.png)-->

**Notes ‚ùó**

> In case the category you want to store the component under doesn't exist, open `LibPath.ts`
> which is located under `src/Types` and add a new enum for your category under `LibPath`.

> Note! `_componentName_` is not to be confused with the variable `componentName` that we
> declared in step 4.

<br />

## Step 5.1 (Potentially skippable):

If the new component has a property which takes an array, struct, etc. containing child elements
like shown below for a component named Accordion, some additional steps must be taken,
**otherwise proceed with step 6**. The reason behind this is to prevent a MDX related bug
to occur inside of the "Show Code" fields in Storybook.

```jsx
<Meta
    title={LibPath.Disclosure + componentName}
    component={Accordion}
    args={{
        items: [
            {
                title: 'Accordion 1',
                content: <div>Content 1</div>,
                badge: '',
            },
            {
                title: 'Accordion 2',
                content: <div>Content 2</div>,
                badge: '',
            },
        ],
        allowMultiple: true,
    }}
/>
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> Follow the link to learn more about the [MDXCreateElement-bug](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/11542).

<br />

## Step 5.2:

Start off by creating a file call `PropItems.tsx` inside of the same folder as
`_componentName_.tsx` and `_componentName_.stories.mdx`. After that add the following import-statement:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> Make sure to include all the other necessary import-statements at the top of the file if you
> add/use components which aren't included in `React`.

<br />

## Step 5.3:

Now its time to add a new export which holds the property value (array, struct, etc.) we want to
use inside of `_componentName_.stories.mdx `. The value of `_exportName_` should always be `Default`
if the specific property value is being used inside `args` of the Meta-tag.

```jsx
export const _exportName_ = [
    ...
];
```

For a component named Accordion the implementation should look like this:

```jsx
export const Default = [
    {
        title: 'Accordion 1',
        content: <div>Content 1</div>,
        badge: '',
    },
    {
        title: 'Accordion 2',
        content: <div>Content 2</div>,
        badge: '',
    },
];
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> More exports will be added to `PropItems.tsx` in regards to stories later on (step 9.1).

> `_exportName_` should always be the same as the story name without any whitespaces, when adding a
> new export for a story. Example given below:
>
> ```jsx
> export const AccordionInProgress = [
>     {
>         title: 'Accordion 1',
>         content: <div>Content 1</div>,
>         badge: 'InProgress',
>     },
>     {
>         title: 'Accordion 2',
>         content: <div>Content 2</div>,
>         badge: 'InProgress',
>     },
> ];
> ```

<br />

## Step 5.4:

After having created and edited `PropItems.tsx` go back to `_componentName_.stories.mdx` and add the import-
statement shown below to the top of the file. This makes all exports inside `PropItems.tsx` available under
the name `PropItems`.

```jsx
import * as PropItems from './PropItems';
```

<br />

## Step 5.5:

The last step now is to use our imported property values inside of `args`. To do this use the following syntax:

```jsx
<Meta
    title={LibPath._category_ + componentName}
    component={_componentName_}
    args={{
        items: PropItems.Default,
        ...
    }}
/>
```

For a component named Accordion the implementation should look like this:

```jsx
<Meta
    title={LibPath.Disclosure + componentName}
    component={Accordion}
    args={{
        items: PropItems.Default,
        allowMultiple: true,
    }}
/>
```

<br />

## Step 6:

Next up use the earlier imported `DocsPageHeader` component. This is a special made React
component which adds a default header layout to the docs-page.

```jsx
<DocsPageHeader
    title={componentName}
    description="..."
    addImportantNote={...}
    variant="..."
/>
```

For a component named TextAreaInput the DocsPageHeader-tag should look like this:

```jsx
<DocsPageHeader
    title={componentName}
    description="This component is used to create an input which accepts text (numbers, 
    letters and special characters) in a large and extendable textarea."
    addImportantNote={false}
    variant="stable"
/>
```

<!--![Example of how the DocsPageHeader-tag should look like](https://i.imgur.com/TJyNTWu.png)-->

**Notes ‚ùó**

> The table below shows all of the props for the DocsPageHeader component.

<ArgsTable of={DocsPageHeader} />

> The props `title` and `description` are used to declare a heading and description. Please note that
> `description` accepts either a string or JSX-elements as value. `variant` is responsible for adding a
> stability-badge. This badge is supposed to give a quick and easy way of knowing if a component is
> stable or not, use `none` if it is desired that no badge should be displayed. The prop `addImportantNote`
> adds an alert message to the top of the docs-page which will display the text defined in `noteMessage`.
> Note that `noteMessage` isn't mandatory and will only be required when `addImportantNote` is set to `true`.

<br />

## Step 7:

It's time to add the first Story to the docs-page, and the most important one at that! The following
story has the main task of showing a baseline implementation of the React component. Therefore, the
`name` property should be given a default value equal to `Base`.

```jsx
<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story name="Base">{Template.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> The `withToolbar` prop enables a toolbar at the top of the code-canvas which includes buttons for zooming.

> `Template.bind({})` takes the earlier defined arrow-function (step 4) and provides a reference to the Story.

> Sometimes the default height of the Canvas isn't enough to display the whole component, in this case a scrollbar
> is automatically added to the Canvas. This is not a desirable solution since it makes viewing the whole component
> tedious. To solve this issue, use the `height` property of the Story-tag like shown below:
>
> ```jsx
> <Canvas withToolbar>
>     <Story name="Base" height="300px">
>         {Template.bind({})}
>     </Story>
> </Canvas>
> ```

<br />

## Step 8:

Now append the remaining standardized docs-page content by using the `DocsPageBodyComponents` component. Just like with
`DocsPageHeader` this will automatically add a couple of elements to the docs-page.

```jsx
<DocsPageBodyComponents addStories={true} />
```

**Notes ‚ùó**

> The table below shows all of the props for the DocsPageBodyComponents component.

<ArgsTable of={DocsPageBodyComponents} />

> In most cases it is desired to add customized stories to showcase what the component could look like
> with different setting, but if that isn't the case change `addStories` to `false` and ignore step 9.

<br />

## Step 9:

The last thing left now is to add customized stories. These stories will help showcase how the component
will look and "feel" when its props are being configured in a certain way. In order to define a certain set
off props we have to override the default props which are defined in the Meta-tag, this is done by using
the `args` prop of the Story-tag. Make sure to replace `_storyName_` with a unique and meaningful name.

```jsx
### _storyName_

<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story
        name="_storyName_"
        args={{
            label: 'What is the reason for your application?',
            placeholder: 'This input is not available yet!',
            backgroundColor: '#F9E5E5',
            isDisabled: true,
            captionText: '',
        }}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```

Repeat this step for as many stories as needed! For a component named TextAreaInput two of its stories
could look like this:

```jsx
### Disabled TextAreaInput

<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story
        name="Disabled TextAreaInput"
        args={{
            label: 'What is the reason for your application?',
            placeholder: 'This input is not available yet!',
            backgroundColor: '#F9E5E5',
            isDisabled: true,
            captionText: '',
        }}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Limited TextAreaInput

<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story
        name="Limited TextAreaInput"
        args={{
            label: 'What is your current occupation?',
            placeholder: 'Enter a short description. (max 50 characters)',
            width: '50%',
            textAlign: 'center',
            captionText: 'Hint! Honesty is the best policy.',
        }}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```

<!--![Example of how two stories should look like](https://i.imgur.com/7qXtRZx.png)-->

**Notes ‚ùó**

> `###` is a special MDX-syntax for creating a `<h3>` element.

> Story names can include whitespaces, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters, but try to
> follow existing naming patterns and conventions by looking at the story names of existing components.

<br />

## Step 9.1 (Potentially skippable):

If you previously have followed the steps 5.1 - 5.5, you'll need to redo steps 5.3 and 5.5 for all the stories
which override the default value of the property that holds an array, struct, etc. containing child elements,
**otherwise proceed with step 10**. An example of a story which overrides the default property implementation
is given beneath:

```jsx
<Canvas withToolbar>
    <Story
        name="Accordion InProgress"
        args={{
            items: [
                {
                    title: 'Accordion 1',
                    content: <div>Content 1</div>,
                    badge: 'InProgress',
                },
                {
                    title: 'Accordion 2',
                    content: <div>Content 2</div>,
                    badge: 'InProgress',
                },
            ],
        }}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
```

<br />

## Step 10 (Quality control):

It was said that the previous step was the last, but theoretically this is the last step. üòÖ Since after
creating and adding a new React component to Storybook, it is necessary to quality check all the new
source code. This can be easily done by using Lint which is set up for this project. All that needs to be
done is executing the following command in the project folder and adjust the source code if any
errors/warnings are thrown.

```
 yarn run lint
```
