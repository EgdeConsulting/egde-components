<hr />

This frontend-library contains a variety of sleek looking, easy to use and rich React components which
build upon [Charka UI](https://storybook.chakra-ui.com/?path=/story/components-data-display-badge--basic).
The primary goal of this library is to provide frontend elements, templates and more that are all free
to use as this is an open-source project.

<br />

# General information ðŸ“ƒ

<br />

## Components ðŸ“¦

All components are documented with an overview of its layout, props, and potential use cases. In
addition, they are marked with one of the three stability-badges. These will quickly tell if the
component in question is working properly, has issues, or is on the way out.

<ComponentStability variant="stable" />
<ComponentStability variant="unstable" />
<ComponentStability variant="deprecated" />

<br />

It's also possible to play around with the components regarding viewport, WCAG, and colouring
inside of the `Canvas` tab.

Another thing to note is that some component might include a warning at the top of the page (as shown
below). These warnings contain important information in regard to the component so make sure to read
them!

<div className={'docsPage'}>
    <ChakraProvider theme={styles}>
        <Alert
            description={
                'There is a bug with this component which is yet to be fixed!'
            }
            status="warning"
            hasNoCloseButton={true}
        />
    </ChakraProvider>
</div>

<br />
