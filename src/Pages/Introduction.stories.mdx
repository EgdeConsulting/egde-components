<hr />

This frontend-library contains a variety of sleek looking, easy to use and rich React components which build upon [Charka UI](https://storybook.chakra-ui.com/?path=/story/components-data-display-badge--basic).
The primary goal of this library is to provide frontend elements, templates and more that are all free to use as this is an open-source project.

working properly, has issues, or is on the way out.

<ComponentStability variant="stable" />
<ComponentStability variant="unstable" />
<ComponentStability variant="deprecated" />

## License

As this is an open-source project anyone can use and further develop the contents of the library to their liking. The only thing to
