# Testing ✅

<hr />

For this project, testing is set up so that all components have one standard snapshot test,
and several individual unit tests which all use the Jest framework. How many unit tests each
component has varies depending on the complexity of the component, but all of them have at
least one unit test that checks if the component is able to render.

<br />

## General testing:

To run all the Jest-tests for all of the components inside the project, execute the following
command e.g., inside the built-in terminal of your IDE:

```
yarn test
```

**Notes ❗**

> If only a single component needs to be tested define its name (`_componentName_`) in the command
> like this:
>
> ```
> yarn test _componentName_
> ```

> All of the snapshot tests are tightly connected to the React components implementation, which means
> that changes made to the component (`_componentName_`) also need to be reflected in the snapshot test.
> This can easily be done by using the following command:
>
> ```
> yarn test _componentName_ -u
> ```
