This frontend-library contains a variety of sleek looking, easy to use and rich React components which
build upon [Charka UI](https://storybook.chakra-ui.com/?path=/story/components-data-display-badge--basic).
The primary goal of this library is to provide frontend elements, templates and more that are all free
to use as this is an open-source project.

If you want to learn how to install or use this library, or just browse all of the components, head over to: [Egde Component Library Online](https://egdeconsulting.github.io/egde-components).
